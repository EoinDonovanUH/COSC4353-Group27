hello 
## Question 1: Initial thoughts
The overall goal of our software application is to calculate the rate of fuel that we provide to customers. That is, we will determine the price we will charge the client for fuel, depending on a compilation of factors (distance, in or out of state, fuel ordered). Implement some kind of data structure to organize and store all new and existing customers. Develop modules to accomplish the requirements stated by client. When designing our software we will keep in mind the user experience ensuring our software is easily interacted with. Using  UML we will define our software and its modules.
