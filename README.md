# COSC4353-Group27
hello 
## Question 1: Initial thoughts
The overall goal of our software application is to calculate the rate of fuel that we provide to customers. That is, we will determine the price we will charge the client for fuel, depending on a compilation of factors (distance, in or out of state, fuel ordered). Implement some kind of data structure to organize and store all new and existing customers. Develop modules to accomplish the requirements stated by client. When designing our software we will keep in mind the user experience ensuring our software is easily interacted with. Using  UML we will define our software and its modules. 
## Question 2: Development Methodology
We will be using Agile as our development methodology. We will be using Agile for this project because this project will involve incremental design changes and on of Agileâ€™s characteristics is that of rapid, incremental delivery of software. This will allow us to develop the software iteratively and continue to better our software without extended periods of time it takes to develop a system.
